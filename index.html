							<h2>Poem Analysis</h2>
							<p>In his poem, “American Sonnet for My Past and Future Assassin”, Terrance Hayes writes about the randomness, yet inevitability of police targeting and attacking of blacks. The poem, written in sonnet form, uses very little rhyme but significant repetition to effectively portray Hayes’ fear that police brutality will continue and lead to children falling victim to it as a result of their dark skin. One abstract interpretation of Hayes’ use of a strict sonnet form for this poem is his potential representation of how strict and rigid someone with black skin must act in order to avoid racial mistreatment. Hayes also uses very ambiguous words to portray the danger of being black, repeating words such as “probably”, “almost”, and “something” in an attempt to signify that whether it be killings, imprisonment, or other mistreatments, racial profiling is and will continue to take place. The poem as a whole provides insight into the separation and fear of the black community. The fear that police brutality will continue and lead to children falling victim to the mistreatment as a result of there dark skin, and how this has not changed from generations before as their skin matches that of their parents and other ancestors. There seems to be some insight into the night time having an effect on the already apparent danger of having black skin, as the twilight and darkness makes one a target and potential prey for the racially biased police that roam the inner cities after the sun sets.

							<h2>"4 Your Eyez Only" Analysis</h2>
							<p>In “4 Your Eyez Only”, J. Cole focuses on the consistency and common nature of police brutality as a black man. J. Cole uses very short, fast, and choppy lines to quickly and effectively portray his anger about the violent mistreatment of blacks, much like someone with black skin may try to plea or bargain with a police officer in an attempt to protect themselves. 
Cole’s use of rhyme in “4 Your Eyez Only” also works to effectively connect and portray his anger and frustration with the overall theme of racial mistreatment. Cole uses consonant rhyme between “daily” and “deadly” as one example to signify how often this mistreatment is happening. He also uses a perfect rhyme between “criminal” and “subliminal” to signify the natural and subconscious inclination of police officers to treat blacks as criminals. Cole’s anger and frustration in this song is very similar to Hayes’ frustration as to how commonly and naturally racial mistreatment occurs these days.

											Hey, niggas be dying on the daily<br>
It seems my dreams faded for far too long<br>
The consequences deadly<br>
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal<br>
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal<br>
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off<br>
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause<br>
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black<br>

							<h2>"High For Hours" Analysis</h2>
							<p>In his song “High For Hours”, Cole raps about how common it is to see police mistreat and kill blacks without any reason or regret. This song has a much more calm and collected tone to it than “4 Your Eyez Only”, and Cole almost seems baffled as to why this mistreatment is continuously happening, stating, “Watched them high-five each other / For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill". Cole also writes with a very accusatory tone in this song, questioning the police as to how they can justify their actions and live with the guilt of somebody’s son “layin’ breathless”. Cole uses rhyming in this song again to more effectively connect and portray his thoughts on the matter. He uses a perfect rhyme between “kill” and “Ville”, as well as rhyming “gun” with “dumb” and “death wish” with “breathless” phonetically through his unique pronunciation of the words. J. Cole’s confusion and anger is portrayed in this song with a very calm and collected tone, as he questions why and how racial mistreatment seems to happen continuously without guilt or regret by police.

											I stood there for a second<br>
Watched them high-five each other<br>
For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill"<br>
But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville<br>
Claimin' that he reached for a gun<br>
They really think we dumb and got a death wish<br>
Now somebody's son is layin' breathless<br>

							<h2>Comparison</h2>
							<p>J. Cole and Terrance Hayes share a very similar message in their works, the atrocity of racial mistreatment. Terrance Hayes attacks this issue fairly ambiguously, speaking of “something” that will “probably” happen again to someone with black skin, whether it be a murder or the imprisonment of a black. J. Cole faces this issue very straight forward, as he references the potential for killing or the death of someone with black skin in both of these songs, potentially speaking from his own experiences. Both artists write and speak with anger and frustration about the racial mistreatment that is continuously occurring without reason or regret, however, Hayes uses very structured, yet general language to portray his feelings while J. Cole uses short, choppy, and seemingly unstructured lyrics to attack and illustrate his thoughts on the matter. The artists use lines with similar meanings in their works, as they are both trying to represent the outrage coming from the black society against this mistreatment. Hayes’ line “Probably someone is prey in all of our encounters” shares a very similar meaning to these lines J. Cole uses in “4 Your Eyez Only”, “Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause / 
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black”. In both cases, the lines used represent the danger of being black in today's society, as no matter what situation one is in there is always the potential, and inevitability of racial mistreatment to occur. Hayes’ lines “Of a black man matches the dark blue skin / Of his son the way one twilight matches another.” connect closely to J. Cole’s line “Now somebody's son is layin' breathless” as they represent the danger in being a black man, especially as one oblivious to the fact that darkness shadows their personality and humanity and simply makes them a dangerous figure easily targeted by police.
